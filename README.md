## :spanner: Core Features
### :round_drawing_pin: Route Tracking
- Saves the ridden route (GPS-based).
- Displays distance covered, average speed, and time spent.
- Users can view and rate routes shared by others.
### :compass: Route Sharing and Categorization
- Users can share their favorite riding routes.
- Roads are categorized: **offroad**, **asphalt**, **mixed roads**, etc.
- Routes can include descriptions, difficulty level, and photos.
### :sos: Emergency Assistance Feature
- Ability to mark an exact location and describe the issue (e.g., mechanical failure).
- Nearby users can see the assistance request and respond.
- Replaces the need for Facebook posts in urgent situations.
### :silhouettes: Live User Map
- Displays registered users on the map (if visibility is enabled).
- Option to join others on the same route or start a group ride.
### :loudspeaker: Info Board & Classifieds
- Shared information space for motorcycle-related topics:
  - Events (gatherings, races)
  - Classifieds (parts, bikes, gear)
  - Services (workshops, repairs, transport, etc.)
- Ability to filter by topic, location, or date.

## :world_map: Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the development plan for the **Moto Tracker App**, a Flutter-based motorcycle tracking app with local GPS tracking, route sharing, real-time user map, and emergency alerts.

<details>
<summary>Phase 1: Project Setup</summary>
- Install Flutter, Android Studio, and device emulator.
- Initialize Flutter project.
- Set up Firebase project (Firestore, Realtime DB, Auth, Storage).
- Add essential Flutter packages: `sqflite`, `google_maps_flutter`, `geolocator`, `firebase_core`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_auth`, `firebase_messaging`.
- Configure Android app with Firebase (`google-services.json`).
**Deliverable:**
Basic Flutter app runs on Android with Firebase connected.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Phase 2: Local Route Tracking</summary>
- Implement GPS tracking using `geolocator`.
- Create SQLite database schema for rides and GPS points.
- Implement start/stop ride buttons.
- Calculate ride statistics: distance, time, average speed.
- Display ride route on Google Maps with polylines.
**Deliverable:**
Rider can start/stop a ride and see the route + stats on the map.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Phase 3: Route Sharing & Firestore Integration</summary>
- Add Firebase Firestore for storing shared rides.
- Sync local rides to Firestore when online.
- Include ride metadata: title, description, road type, difficulty, photos.
- Create UI to view shared rides from other users.

**Deliverable:**
Users can share rides online and view others’ rides.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Phase 4: Real-time Features & SOS Alerts</summary>
- Implement live user location tracking using Firebase Realtime DB.
- Display other active users on the map (if visibility enabled).
- Add SOS button: mark exact location and description of problem.
- Send notifications to nearby users using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- Optional: add “join group ride” feature.
**Deliverable:**
Live user map works; SOS alerts can be sent/received in real time.

<details>
<summary>Phase 6: Polishing & Testing</summary>
- Improve UI/UX: buttons, maps, stats display.
- Test GPS tracking accuracy and map polylines.
- Test Firebase sync: offline → online transitions.
- Test SOS alerts and notifications.
- Bug fixes, code cleanup, and comments.
**Deliverable:**
Stable, functional app ready for submission/demo.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Phase 7: Free Testing & Deployment</summary>
- Build debug/release APK: `flutter build apk --debug`
